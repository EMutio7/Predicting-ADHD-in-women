# Predicting-ADHD-in-women
Building a model to predict both an individualâ€™s sex and their ADHD diagnosis using functional brain imaging data of children and adolescents and their socio-demographic, emotions, and parenting information.

Models of this nature can help identify individuals who may be at risk of ADHD, which can be difficult to diagnose particularly in females. Importantly, they help shed light on the parts of the brain relevant to ADHD in females and males, which in turn could lead to improvements in personalized medicine and therapies. Identifying ADHD early and designing therapies targeting specific brain mechanisms in a personalized way can greatly improve the mental health of affected individuals.

The F1 score is the harmonic mean of the precision and recall. It thus symmetrically represents both precision and recall in one metric. The highest possible value of an F-score is 1.0, indicating perfect precision and recall, and the lowest possible value is 0, if precision and recall are zero.
